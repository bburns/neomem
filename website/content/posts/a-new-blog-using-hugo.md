## A new blog, using Hugo

2021-02-07

Needing a new site, and wanting to have a blog on it, I looked at a few static site generators -

- Eleventy (11ty) - JavaScript
- Gatsby - React/JavaScript/GraphQL
- Hugo - Go

Eleventy didn't seem to have a good architecture, and the documentation wasn't very encouraging. Gatsby seemed interesting and well-designed, but was terribly slow. Hugo is _fast_, and seems well planned out and organized.
