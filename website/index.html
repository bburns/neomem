    <p>Neomem: an open source information manager</p>

    <p>
      Neomem is an information manager with plugins for different datasources
      and views.
    </p>

    <p>
      You select an item from the database and can view it in different ways -
      as a table, or a document, or chart.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plan is to have a free and open source information manager for
      different types of data, with optional paid hosting plans to store data in
      the cloud and collaborate with others.
    </p>

    <p>
      Development started in August 2020 and is ongoing, with a launch planned
      for March 2021.
