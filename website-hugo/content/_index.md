Neomem is a combination table and document editor, with free and paid hosting plans and a marketplace for plugins. 

You can filter, sort, group, and edit data from different sources in the same way - files, bookmarks, email, database, etc.

<!-- Neomem lets you view and edit your data in different ways. You can select an item and view it as a table, or a document, or chart, for example.  -->

Development is ongoing, with a launch planned for April 2021. 

It's open source and cross-platform. More information at https://github.com/bburns/neomem.
