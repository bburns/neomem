Neomem is an information manager - a combination table and document editor, with paid hosting plans and a marketplace for plugins. 

Open source and cross-platform.

Neomem lets you view and edit your data in different ways. You can select an item and view it as a table, or a document, or chart, for example. 

Development is ongoing, with a launch planned for April 2021. 

Check out the project with more information at https://github.com/bburns/neomem.
