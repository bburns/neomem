Neomem is a combination table and document editor, with free and paid hosting plans and a marketplace for plugins.

You can filter, sort, group, and edit data from different sources in the same way - files, bookmarks, email, database, etc.

It's open source and cross-platform. More information at https://github.com/bburns/Neomem.

Development is ongoing, with a launch planned for August 2021.
