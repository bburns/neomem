Okay, here is my new blog, stored in / generated by Neomem. I'll try to make it look nicer later.

I'm hoping that writing a blog in Neomem will get me to make it functional faster. 

I've been spending weekends lately working on it, but every time I come back to it I think - this is too complex - and try again. Maybe eventually it'll settle on a good architecture. 

Last week I found ArangoDB, which is faster and uses less memory than Neo4j, and I like the query language a bit better. So I'm going to try that for the main storage.

But for now, this is stored in a json file along with other test data. Keeping it as simple as possible for now.</div>
