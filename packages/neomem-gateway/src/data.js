I'm hoping that writing a blog in Neomem will get me to make it functional faster. 

I've been spending weekends lately working on it, but every time I come back to it I think - this is too complex - and try again. Maybe eventually it'll settle on a good architecture. 

Last week I found ArangoDB, which is faster and uses less memory than Neo4j, and I like the query language a bit better. So I'm going to try that for the main storage.

But for now, this is stored in a json file along with other test data. Keeping it as simple as possible for now.`,

- Eleventy (11ty) - JavaScript
- Gatsby - React/JavaScript/GraphQL
- Hugo - Go

Eleventy didn't seem to have a good architecture, and the documentation wasn't very encouraging. Gatsby seemed interesting and well-designed, but was terribly slow. Hugo is _fast_, and seems well planned out and organized.

        notes: `I'm trying to figure out how to handle types - Neomem needs to understand a set of basic types, and to translate between those and each datasource's types.

e.g. Chrome Bookmarks have a 'date_added' field, which is based on the year 1601. We'll need to translate that to the 'created' field, which is an ISO datestring like '2021-02-08', and vice-versa.

We could store a library of these datatypes, usable by different datasources. e.g. 'date1601', in case some other datasource needed it also.

Put this in neomem-util? neomem-types? neomem-data?

Types need to be dynamic, as with neo4j - user will be able to define new types/labels as needed, and they can contain fields, or relations with other nodes.`,

I'm going to make a simpler blog - I'm not crazy about Hugo, it's a bit complex for what I need. I just want a page with little blurbs and links to articles.
