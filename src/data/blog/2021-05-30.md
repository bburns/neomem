My plan at the moment is to use Postgres for the main datastore - it'll have nodes, edges, and history tables - the latter will be a TimescaleDB table, so it can archive and drop off data as needed.

This structure should work with the other project as well, so they can feed off each other. Later, when need to integrate different datasources, could try Stardog to link them together.

I'm going to make a simpler blog - I'm not crazy about Hugo - it's a bit complex for what I need, and I spent too much time trying to adapt a template to what I needed. I just want a page with little blurbs and links to articles. So going back to a simple html generator.
