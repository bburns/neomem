I looked at a few static site generators -

- Eleventy (11ty) - JavaScript
- Gatsby - React/JavaScript/GraphQL
- Hugo - Go

I tried Eleventy but wasn't crazy about the architecture and documentation. Gatsby seemed interesting and well-designed, but was terribly slow. Hugo is fast, and seems well planned out and organized.
